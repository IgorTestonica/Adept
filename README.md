Adept
========

###Use LabVIEW to communicate with user defined registers on Digilent FPGA boards.

The MakerHub Interface for Adept provides an easy-to-use API for communicating with Digilent FPGA Boards. The Interface for Adept is built on the Digilent Adept API and follows the common LabVIEW open, read/write, close paradigm and makes it easy to debug, configure, and control VHDL or Verilog FPGA applications using Digilent FPGA Boards.
